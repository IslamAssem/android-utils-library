<b>Android Utils Library</b> [![](https://jitpack.io/v/IslamAssem/android-utils-library.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#IslamAssem/android-utils-library)

------

This is a utils library with a small, extensible API which providers utility on top of Android's application develop.

I copy this utils into all the little apps I make, I'm tired of doing it, I'm lazzy. Now it's a library.

Usage
-----

**Gradle Build**

Add libraries to your dependencies:

project gradle
``` gradle
allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}
```

app gradle
``` gradle
dependencies {
	        implementation 'com.github.IslamAssem:android-utils-library:1.0.4'
	}
```
